# Rendering

Render Truck shapes with the built-in wgpu-based engine. This chapter introduces the rendering pipeline and a simple viewer.

Topics:

- **4.1 First Empty Window** — create a window with a GPU context
- **4.2 First Scene** — load and draw a shape
- **4.3 Update Scene** — animate or modify each frame
- **4.4 Simple Viewer** — build a minimal viewer for your models

Let’s start by opening your first rendering window.
